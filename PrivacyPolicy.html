                                        <strong>4. HOW DOES ANG STUDIO HANDLE CHILDREN'S INFORMATION?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>A. Children's Use of the Platforms.</strong></p>
                                    <p>ANG Studio has developed its Platforms to be an enjoyable experience for users of all ages. Some parts of the Platforms are primarily targeted at children, such as many of our Apps, while others are intended for parents, such as our Sites and Programs. Whenever we refer to children in this Privacy Policy, we mean children under the age of 13, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
                                    <p>ANG Studio complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (<strong>COPPA</strong>), a U.S. law designed to protect the online privacy of children. ANG Studio takes precautions designed to protect the online privacy of children, and we encourage parents to take an active role in protecting their children's privacy by discussing this Privacy Policy with them. If you are a data subject in Europe or a California resident and have a child under the age of 16, please see the <a href="#13"><strong>What Should I Know as a Data Subject in Europe?</strong></a> and <strong>What Should I Know as a California Resident?</strong> sections below.</p>
                                    <p>If you have any questions or comments about how we treat children's information or our compliance with COPPA, please contact us as set out in the <a href="#12"><strong>How Do I Contact ANG Studio?</strong></a> section. If you would like to learn more about COPPA, you can refer to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy" target="_blank">Children's Privacy</a> section of the Federal Trade Commission's website.</p>
                                    <p><strong>B. Sites and Programs.</strong> ANG Studio does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by COPPA from children through its Sites or Programs. If we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal information from a child in violation of COPPA, we will promptly delete it. Parents should note that if they provide information about their child through a Site or Program, COPPA will not apply to that information.</p>
                                    <p><strong>C. Apps.</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>• List of Child Directed Apps.</strong></p>
                                    <p>For a list of Apps that ANG Studio treats as being primarily directed to children under COPPA (<strong>Child Directed Apps</strong>), please contact us as set out in the <a href="#12"><strong>How Do I Contact ANG Studio?</strong></a> section.</p>
                                    <p><strong>• Collection, Use, and Sharing of Information from Children.</strong></p>
                                    <p>We collect, use and share personal information from children through our Apps as follows:</p>
                                    <p>•<strong>Registration</strong>. For our Child Directed Apps, ANG Studio treats all users as children and does not screen users for age or offer registration.</p>
                                    <p>•<strong>Email Contact</strong>. On occasion, in order to respond to a question or request from a child through a Child Directed App, ANG Studio may receive or need to ask for the child's online contact information, such as an email address. ANG Studio will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.</p>
                                    <p>•<strong>Photos, Videos, and Audio.</strong> Our Child Directed Apps may request access to the device's camera, photo album, or microphone in order to provide in-game functionality. For example, a child may blow into the microphone in order to blow out cartoon candles or take a photo of their arm with a cartoon bracelet and save that image to their local device. ANG Studio does not store or share any photos, videos, or audio files that contain children's images or voices through our Child Directed Apps. All photos, videos, and audio files are stored locally on the device only.</p>
                                    <p>•<strong>Local Notifications.</strong> Our Child Directed Apps may allow children to receive local notifications on their devices. This means that the Child Directed App may send notifications to the device at preset times, but will not collect any personal information in connection with the notifications. These notifications may be turned off at any time through device settings. We do not use push notifications in our Child Directed Apps.</p>
                                    <p>•<strong>Persistent Identifiers.</strong> ANG Studio collects, uses and shares persistent identifiers, such as device identifiers or IP addresses, through our Child Directed Apps solely for the purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Child Directed Apps or as otherwise permitted by COPPA and other applicable data protection laws. This information may be collected by ANG Studio or another entity providing a service to ANG Studio.</p>
                                    <p>•<strong>In-App Advertising.</strong> Some of our Child Directed Apps incorporate advertising serving technology offered by our service providers, which enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the game and replaced while the user plays. The data collected for this purpose may include persistent identifiers solely for the purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Child Directed App as permitted by COPPA and other applicable data protection laws, such as allowing our service providers to calculate the number of views, cap the frequency of ads and serve ads in a format that fits the device. Please note that while our Child Directed Apps may contain advertisements about ANG Studio or products and services of another entity, we prohibit behavioral advertising to children in our Child Directed Apps or through data collected from our Child Directed Apps.</p>
                                    <p>Subject to our compliance with COPPA and other applicable data protection laws, ANG Studio may collect, use, share and otherwise process personal information from children in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also seek verifiable parental consent as necessary to comply with COPPA and other applicable data protection laws. In either case, we will not collect more personal information from children than is reasonably necessary to participate in our Child Directed Apps.</p>
                                    <p><strong>• Security</strong></p>
                                    <p>We take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's personal information collected through Child Directed Apps, including by taking reasonable steps to release such information only to parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality and security. We retain children's personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, and delete such information using reasonable measures to protect against its unauthorized access or use.</p>
                                    <p><strong>• Parental Choices and Controls</strong></p>
                                    <p>As part of the verifiable parental consent process, where applicable, parents and legal guardians will have the choice of consenting to our collection and internal use of their child's personal information but prohibiting us from disclosing that information to other entities (except to the extent such disclosure is integral to our Apps). Additionally, any parent has the right to: (1) review, correct, or delete the child's personal information; and/or (2) discontinue further collection, use, or sharing of the child's personal information. Please note that exercising these choices may restrict your child's ability to access certain functionality of the Apps. To exercise any of these choices, please contact us as set out in the How Do I Contact ANG Studio? section.</p>
                                    <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe that we have collected your child's personal information in violation of COPPA, please contact us as set out in the <a href="#12"><strong>How Do I Contact ANG Studio?</strong></a> Section, and we will remove such information to the extent required by COPPA. </p>

                                    <p>You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the Platforms that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information.</p>
                                    <p><strong>B.</strong> <strong>Information Collected Automatically.</strong></p>
                                    <p>ANG Studio automatically collects information about your use of the Platforms to help us improve our services or for other purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. We automatically collect the following categories of information:</p>

                                    <p>• <strong>Cookies,</strong> which are small data files stored on your device that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. Use of cookies makes web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving language preferences and maintaining your sessions while you are on our Sites. The cookies used on our Sites contain information used for site navigation and analytics and are used in combination with pixels, as further discussed below.</p>
                                    <p>• <strong>Pixels</strong> (also known as web beacons), which is code embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or another entity to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us to track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Sites, and provide you with additional functionality.</p>
                                    <p>• <strong>Device Fingerprinting,</strong> which is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device's browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a fingerprint of your device and uniquely identify your browser and device.</p>
                                    <p>• <strong>App Technologies,</strong> which are technologies included in our Apps that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our Apps include SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server. These SDKs allow us to analyze the performance of our Apps, bring you advertising both on and off the Apps, and provide you with additional functionality. However, for our Child Directed Apps, we do not collect information for behavioral advertising.</p>

                                    <p>• <strong>Service Providers.</strong> We transfer information to service providers that perform services on our behalf or otherwise collect, use, disclose, store or process information on our behalf for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy (such as for completing purchases, data analytics, marketing and advertising, website hosting, and technical support). Some of these service providers may be located in a country other than where you reside, including in Canada or the United States, and your information may be stored or processed in those countries. We implement reasonable contractual measures designed to ensure that our service providers provide appropriate protection for your information and use your information only for the purpose of providing the services to us. Your information may be subject to the legal requirements of the country in which it is located, including lawful requirements to disclose information to government authorities in those countries only. Our employees and those of our agents and service providers who require it in order to fulfill their job requirements will have access to your information.</p>
                                    <p>• <strong>Partners.</strong> ANG Studio shares information with our partners in connection with offering co-branded services, selling or distributing our products, or engaging in joint marketing activities.</p>

By entering a Promotion, you agree to the official rules of that Promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials. Unless specifically indicated with additional terms, Promotions are only directed to adults and non-child users.</p>
                                    <p>• <strong>Business Transactions</strong>. We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets or rights relating thereto.</p>
                                    <p>• <strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may share information with our affiliates for their own business purposes.</p>
                                    <p>• <strong>Legal Rights and Obligations.</strong> We may use and/or disclose your information to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage. When necessary, we may also disclose information to law enforcement, or to the appropriate civil authorities.</p>
                                    <p>• <strong>Consent.</strong> We may share information to fulfill any other purpose as directed by you or with your consent. Generally, by providing us with information, we will assume that you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of such information for the purposes identified at the time that we collect the information from you or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. In the case of children under 13, as applicable, we will obtain a parent or legal guardian's verifiable consent prior to the collection of personal information from such users, unless the collection of such information falls within an exception that is permitted under COPPA or other applicable data protection laws.</p>
                                    <p>Notwithstanding the above, ANG Studio may share or disclose information that does not identify you (including information that has been aggregated and de-identified) with other parties except as prohibited by applicable law.

These other entities may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you. Because we cannot control the activities of other entities, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your information by such entities, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as ANG Studio.

                                    <p>Our Sites and Apps contain Tracking Technologies owned and operated by other entities. For example, we use Tracking Technologies from analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, to help us analyze your use of the Sites and Apps, compile statistical reports on the Site's and Apps' activity, and provide us with other services relating to Site and App activity and internet usage. We also work with ad serving services, advertisers, and other technology services to serve advertisements on the Sites, Apps, and/or on other websites and services. These other entities may use Tracking Technologies on our Sites, Apps, and their own services (including in emails and advertisements) to track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Sites, Apps, and the other entities' own services or third party devices after you have left them (behavioral advertising).</p>
                                    <p>We do not engage in behavioral advertising in our Child Directed Apps. For further information on advertising in Child Directed Apps, please see the <strong>How Does ANG Studio Handle Children's Information?</strong> section above.</p>

                                    <p>If you believe we have collected and stored any personal information from children under 13 in violation of COPPA, parents or legal guardians can request access to review such information, have it deleted, or stop our further collection or use of such information.

                                    <p><strong>B. Tracking Technology Choices.</strong></p>
                                    <p>• <strong>Cookies and Pixels.</strong> Most browsers accept cookies by default. If you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, some areas of our Sites may not function properly.</p>
                                    <p>• <strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Your browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (DNT) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, our Sites' system does not support, monitor, or act on DNT signal headers that we may receive. However, the choices that we provide you concerning collection and use of your information will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy. For more information on Do Not Track, visit <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">https://www.allaboutdnt.com.</a></p>
                                    <p>• <strong>App Technologies.</strong> You can stop all collection of information via an App by uninstalling the App. You can also reset your device Ad Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you.</p>
                                    <p>Please be aware that if you disable or remove Tracking Technologies some parts of the Platforms may not function correctly.</p>

                                    <p>Our Sites use tools such as Google Analytics, Facebook, YouTube and Vimeo. These tools collect data through Tracking Technologies such as cookies, which may be used in accordance with their privacy policies. Please refer to the privacy policies of these entities to learn more about their practices and available opt-outs.</p>
                                    <p>For Google Analytics, you can find their opt-out by visiting: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB</a> and downloading the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on, or visiting Google Analytics for Display Advertising of the Google Display Network at <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.</p>
                                    <p>Where we work with other companies to engage in behavioral advertising, these companies are often members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (<strong>DAA</strong>) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative ("<strong>NAI</strong>"). These programs offer centralized locations where users can make choices about the use of their information for behavioral advertising. To learn more about the DAA's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and your opt-out options for their members, please visit (i) for website opt-out, <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">https://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>; and (ii) for mobile app opt-out, <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>.

                                    <p>You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving targeted ads to you by going to your device settings and selecting Limit Ad Tracking (for iOS devices) or Opt out of Interest-Based Ads (for Android devices).</p>
                                    <p>Please note that any opt-outs only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt-out. Further, opting-out through the DAA or NAI only means that the selected members should no longer deliver certain behavioral advertising to you, and does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any entity's opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their practices or programs.</p>
                                    <p><strong>D. Communications.</strong></p>

You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from us at any time by contacting us as described in the <a href="#12"><strong>How Do I Contact ANG Studio?</strong></a> section below or by using the unsubscribe mechanism included in the email communications you receive.

                                    <p>Our Platforms are operated in Canada, and the information we collect is governed by Canadian law. If you are accessing the Platforms from outside of Canada, please be aware that information collected through the Platforms will be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in Canada, the United States, and other jurisdictions.

If your data is collected in Europe, we will transfer your personal data subject to appropriate safeguards, including standard contractual clauses. </p>

                                        <strong>13. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW AS A DATA SUBJECT IN EUROPE?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>A.</strong> <strong>ANG Studio is a Data Controller.</strong></p>
                                    <p>Data protection laws in Europe make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as controllers) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as processors). ANG Studio acts as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with our apps, websites, emails, and advertisements.</p>
                                    <p><strong>B. ANG Studio has a Lawful Basis for Processing.</strong></p>
                                    <p>Data protection laws in Europe require a lawful basis for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers or partners; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.</p>
                                    <p><strong>C.</strong> <strong>Your European Privacy Rights.</strong></p>
                                    <p>If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.</p>
                                    <p>You may exercise your rights by submitting a written request to us at the address set out in the <a href="#12"><strong>How Do I Contact ANG Studio?</strong></a> section above. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.</p>
                                    <p><strong>D.</strong> <strong>Children in Europe.</strong></p>
                                    <p>Where the basis for our processing of personal data from children under 16 in Europe is consent, we will make appropriate efforts to verify that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over those children, and, if we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal data from those children without parental consent, we will promptly delete it. If you are a child under 16 in Europe, please speak with your parent or guardian about this Privacy Policy so you can better understand how we use your personal data.</p>
                                    <p><strong>E.</strong> <strong>Complaints.</strong></p>
                                    <p>If you have a complaint about our use of your personal data or response to your requests regarding your personal data, you may submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a data protection regulator, and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us.</p>

                                        <strong>15. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW AS A NEVADA RESIDENT?</strong></p>
                                    <p>Nevada consumers may submit requests directing a business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties.
